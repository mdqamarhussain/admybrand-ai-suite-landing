## AI vs. Manual Work Split

  * **AI-generated:** 75% (Component architecture via Lovable.ai, styling foundations, animations, TypeScript interfaces via Cursor/Copilot, content optimization via ChatGPT).
  * **Manual coding:** 25% (Performance optimizations, accessibility enhancements, custom CSS refinements, deployment configuration, cross-browser compatibility fixes).
  * **Customization:** Extensively refined AI outputs for professional polish. This included optimizing glassmorphism effects, implementing comprehensive accessibility features (WCAG focus indicators, keyboard navigation, screen reader support), fine-tuning animations for 60fps performance with hardware acceleration, and creating a cohesive design system with consistent spacing and typography hierarchy.

The strategic use of multiple AI tools allowed for rapid development while maintaining professional code quality and sophisticated visual design that rivals premium SaaS platforms like Linear and Notion.
